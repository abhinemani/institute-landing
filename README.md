# civictech.institute (early planning stage)

## "A Khan Academy for GovTech"
This very early and exploratory initiative is born out of hand-on insight from over a decade in civic tech — this past decade in particular where it’s vital role in our society became obvious. What we’ve seen however is that for both civic tech experts and newcomers to the civic tech family, there’s a dearth of professional development resources and communities.

That’s what the CivicTech.Institute is designed to fix: inject professionalism, standards, and community into the field to help grow and deepen its impact.

There could be many directions this project takes: online courses, workshops, webinars, conferences, book, etc. We are still in the scoping and strategy phase of development (read: early). Your feedback would be greatly appreciated: https://govgeek.io/scoping

## Mission
It’s been said, “In the 21st Century, good governance and good policy are irrevocably linked to good technology.” By building an Academy that helps our public officials better use technology, we can drive towards a fundamentally better government: one that is more efficient, more effective, and — crucially — more responsive to its constituents in the digital era.


## My Ask
A bit of patience. A bit of creativity. And a bit of insight: https://govgeek.io/scoping (Short, but very heplful survey)
